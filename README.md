Data Science Experiments Repository
Overview
This repository is a collection of data science experiments, notes, and code samples primarily written in Jupyter Notebook, R, and Python.
It serves as a lab space for exploring concepts in:

Data Analysis

Machine Learning

Statistical Modeling

Data Visualization

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Each experiment focuses on practical applications and understanding of data-driven techniques.

Index of Experiments
Sr. No.	Title
1	To study basic vector operations in R programming
2	To perform explicit and implicit type conversion on vectors and perform label/one-hot encoding on categorical variables
3	To study useful functions like sample(), subset(), ifelse(), ggplot() etc., and work with different parameters in sample() function
4	Compare ML models (KNN, Random Forest, SVM) on the same dataset & evaluate F1 Score, AUC ROC Score
5	Recreate a matrix in three different ways using dim(), matrix(), & cbind() functions
6	Create a univariate and bivariate visualization using Seaborn to study distribution, trends, and correlation
7	Perform descriptive & statistical analysis to derive insights (mean, median, kurtosis, skewness, etc.)
8	Create and manipulate a data frame in R, understand the use of factors for categorical variables
9	Load & explore data in R using tibbles, perform descriptive analysis, fit a linear regression model & evaluate performance
10	Health Guru Weight Loss Program — Validate the effectiveness using Null Hypothesis Testing
11	Perform Sentiment Analysis on text data (tweets)
12	Perform Feature Engineering & Selection on employee performance dataset (Correlation, ANOVA F-test, Chi-square)
13	Analyze a Government Open Dataset & create visual reports for decision making
14	Perform Text Summarization using NLP
